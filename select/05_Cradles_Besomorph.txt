[Verse 1]
I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep
[Pre-Chorus]
I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
Shh
[Bridge]
Tape my eyes open to force reality (Oh no, no)
Why can't you just let me eat my weight in glee?
[Verse 2]
I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days
Sometimes I can't tell if my body belongs to me
[Pre-Chorus]
I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
Shh
